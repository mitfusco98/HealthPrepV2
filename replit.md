# Health-Prep v2 - HIPAA-Compliant Healthcare Preparation System

### Overview
Health-Prep v2 is a real-time medical preparation sheet generation engine designed to integrate with FHIR-based EMRs (e.g., Epic). It parses incoming patient documents and data, determines eligibility for medical screenings based on customizable logic, and generates prep sheets reflecting the patient's care status. Its core capabilities include an intelligent screening engine with fuzzy detection, dynamic status updates for compliance tracking, comprehensive prep sheet generation, and administrative controls. The project aims to provide a robust solution for healthcare preparation, improving efficiency and compliance.

### User Preferences
- Focus on healthcare compliance and FHIR integration
- Reuse existing template assets where possible
- Maintain separation between user and admin interfaces
- Prioritize screening engine accuracy and performance

### System Architecture

**Backend Structure:**
The backend is organized into modular components: `core/` for the main engine logic (screening orchestration, fuzzy matching, eligibility criteria), `emr/` for FHIR data ingestion and normalization, `ocr/` for document processing (Tesseract integration, quality scoring, PHI filtering), `prep_sheet/` for generation and rendering, and `admin/` for dashboard tools and configuration. Key features include a robust user authentication system with Flask-Login, role-based access control, and HIPAA-compliant templates. A unified `PrepSheetSettings` model manages document cutoff periods. Clean URL structures are implemented for screening management (`/screening/list`, `/screening/types`, `/screening/settings`). Screening name autocomplete with fuzzy detection and alias support, medical conditions database with FHIR-compatible codes, and a tag-based keyword management system facilitate data entry and standardization.

**Frontend Structure:**
The frontend reuses assets from V1, organized under `templates/`. It includes `base_user.html` and `base_admin.html` for distinct user and admin interfaces. Specific directories like `screening/`, `admin/`, `auth/`, and `error/` house templates for various functionalities, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The UI is Bootstrap-based, responsive, and supports a dark theme.

**Key Technical Implementations:**
- Database models for patients, screenings, documents, and conditions.
- User authentication and authorization with password hashing and role-based access.
- Centralized `PrepSheetSettings` for configurable prep sheet generation parameters.
- Screening list architecture aligned with design, consolidating patient listings with screening statuses.
- Clean URL structure for improved navigation and maintainability.
- Comprehensive error handling with dedicated templates.
- OCR processing framework with confidence scoring and configurable PHI filtering patterns.
- Standardized screening names database with fuzzy detection and autocomplete.
- Medical conditions database with FHIR-compatible codes for trigger conditions.
- One-click medical terminology import system and tag-based keyword management.
- Enhanced `ScreeningType` architecture supporting gender/age/condition eligibility, fractional frequencies, and JSON storage for keywords and trigger conditions.
