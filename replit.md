# Health-Prep v2 - HIPAA-Compliant Healthcare Preparation System

## Project Overview
Health-Prep v2 is a real-time medical preparation sheet generation engine designed to integrate with FHIR-based EMRs (e.g., Epic). It parses incoming patient documents and data, determines eligibility for medical screenings based on customizable logic, and generates prep sheets reflecting the patient's care status.

## Core Objectives
- **Intelligent Screening Engine**: Analyzes user-defined screening types with fuzzy detection for equivalent terms
- **Document Processing**: OCR system with quality scoring and HIPAA-compliant PHI filtering
- **Dynamic Status Updates**: Real-time compliance tracking (Complete, Due, Due Soon) based on frequency and last screening dates
- **Comprehensive Prep Sheets**: Include patient headers, medical summaries, quality checklists, and filtered clinical data
- **Administrative Controls**: User management, activity logging, and screening preset management
- **FHIR Integration**: SMART on FHIR workflows for EMR compatibility
