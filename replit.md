# Health-Prep v2 - HIPAA-Compliant Healthcare Preparation System

### Overview
Health-Prep v2 is a real-time medical preparation sheet generation engine designed to integrate with FHIR-based EMRs (e.g., Epic). It parses incoming patient documents and data, determines eligibility for medical screenings based on customizable logic, and generates prep sheets reflecting the patient's care status. Its core capabilities include an intelligent screening engine with fuzzy detection, dynamic status updates for compliance tracking, comprehensive prep sheet generation with enhanced medical data sections, and administrative controls. The system features advanced variant management for screening types, document relevancy filtering, interactive document links, and configurable time periods for medical data display. The project provides a robust solution for healthcare preparation, improving efficiency and compliance.

### User Preferences

### Port Conflict Resolution Strategy
The application implements a **hybrid port conflict resolution system** combining:

1. **Environment-Based Port Configuration**: Application respects `PORT` environment variable for flexible port assignment
2. **Dynamic Port Cleanup**: Smart process cleanup and automatic port detection
3. **Intelligent Fallback**: Automatic alternative port discovery when conflicts occur

**Usage Options:**
- **Standard Mode**: `python main.py` - Basic port handling with fallback
- **Smart Mode**: `USE_SMART_START=true python main.py` - Advanced conflict resolution
- **Production Preview**: `python smart_start.py prod` - Gunicorn on port 5001
- **Direct Smart Start**: `python smart_start.py dev` - Enhanced development server

**Port Configuration:**
- Development: Port 5000 (fallback to 5001-5009)
- Production Preview: Port 5001 (fallback to 5002-5100)
- Custom Port: Set `PORT` environment variable

### System Architecture

**Backend Structure:**
The backend is organized into modular components: `core/` for the main engine logic (screening orchestration, fuzzy matching, eligibility criteria, selective refresh management with criteria change detection), `emr/` for FHIR data ingestion, normalization, and synchronization, `ocr/` for document processing (Tesseract integration, quality scoring, PHI filtering), `prep_sheet/` for generation and rendering, `services/` for Epic FHIR service layer with token management, bidirectional data synchronization, and selective EMR sync with pre-flight checks, and `admin/` for dashboard tools and configuration. Key features include a robust user authentication system with Flask-Login, role-based access control, and HIPAA-compliant templates. A unified `PrepSheetSettings` model manages document cutoff periods. Clean URL structures are implemented for screening management, EMR synchronization, Epic FHIR OAuth2 authentication, and comprehensive user management with role-based access control supporting admin, MA, and nurse roles. Screening name autocomplete with fuzzy detection and alias support, medical conditions database with FHIR-compatible codes, and a tag-based keyword management system facilitate data entry and standardization. Enhanced data models integrate comprehensive FHIR data for Patient and FHIRDocument management. **Performance Optimizations (Oct 2025):** Enhanced status calculation using 30-day window for "due soon" detection, appointment-based prioritization integration with intelligent fallback, selective EMR sync with pre-flight checks to skip unchanged patients, and selective screening refresh with criteria change detection to avoid unnecessary reprocessing.

**Frontend Structure:**
The frontend reuses assets from V1, organized under `templates/`. It includes `base_user.html` and `base_admin.html` for distinct user and admin interfaces. Specific directories like `screening/`, `admin/`, `auth/`, and `error/` house templates for various functionalities. The UI is Bootstrap-based, responsive, and supports a dark theme.

**Key Technical Implementations:**
- Database models for patients, screenings, documents, and conditions.
- User authentication and authorization with password hashing and role-based access.
- Centralized `PrepSheetSettings` for configurable prep sheet generation parameters.
- Screening list architecture aligning patient listings with screening statuses.
- Clean URL structure for improved navigation and maintainability.
- Comprehensive error handling.
- OCR processing framework with confidence scoring and configurable PHI filtering.
- Standardized screening names database with fuzzy detection and autocomplete.

- **Epic Prep Sheet Write-Back System (Oct 2025)**: Comprehensive document write-back functionality enabling manual prep sheet generation and Epic DocumentReference creation. Features include PDF generation with WeasyPrint preserving HTML hyperlinks, timestamp-based versioning in filename format (PrepSheet_{MRN}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.pdf) and embedded content headers, base64-encoded PDF attachment with FHIR R4-compliant DocumentReference structure, automatic OAuth token refresh with connection error handling, individual prep sheet generation via prep sheet icon in matched documents column on /screening/list, bulk prep sheet generation button adjacent to appointment prioritization display using appointment window filtering, comprehensive audit logging for HIPAA compliance tracking all Epic writes, no local storage (Epic-only write-back), and manual generation only (user-triggered, no auto-generation). The system implements a living document concept where each generation creates a new timestamped version in Epic.
