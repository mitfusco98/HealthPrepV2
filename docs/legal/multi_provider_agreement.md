---

## 6. Disclaimers; No Medical Advice

- **No Substitute for Professional Judgment:** The Organization and Providers acknowledge that the Software is **not a replacement for professional medical judgment, advice, diagnosis, or treatment**. HealthPrep is provided for informational purposes only and is intended to supplement, not replace, the clinical judgment of qualified healthcare professionals.

- **Limited Contextual Awareness and Match Accuracy:** The Software's outputs and recommendations are based solely on the data entered. HealthPrep has limited contextual awareness and may not account for all patient-specific factors (e.g., complete medical history, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, or other unique circumstances). The Company does not guarantee the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of any suggestions or "matches" provided by the Software.

- **No Guarantee of Results:** The Organization and Providers agree not to rely solely on the Software's output. The Company makes no representation or warranty regarding the effectiveness of the Software or the results obtained. Providers must verify any information or matches independently and apply their own clinical expertise.

- **As-Is Provision:** EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

- **Cap on Liability:** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

- **Total Liability:** THE COMPANY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL SUBSCRIPTION FEES PAID BY THE ORGANIZATION TO THE COMPANY DURING THE TWELVE (12)-MONTH TERM IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

- **Acknowledgment:** The Organization and Providers acknowledge that these limitations are reasonable and that the Subscription Fee reflects the allocation of risk contemplated by this Agreement.

**By Organization and Providers:** The Organization, on behalf of itself and its Providers, shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Fusco Digital Solutions LLC, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:
- (a) any use of the Software by the Organization or Providers in violation of this Agreement or applicable law;
- (b) any breach by the Organization or Providers of any representation, warranty, or obligation under this Agreement;

- (e) any violation of healthcare regulations (including HIPAA) by the Organization or Providers.

**By Company:** The Company shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Organization and its Providers from any claim brought by a third party alleging that the Software, as provided by the Company and used properly in accordance with this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates any copyright, patent, or other intellectual property right of a third party. This obligation is subject to the Organization providing prompt written notice of any such claim and reasonable cooperation in the defense.

**Exclusions:** The Company shall have no indemnification obligations to the extent any claim arises from modifications made by the Organization or Providers to the Software, or from the combination of the Software with products or data not provided by the Company.

## 9. Suspension and Termination for Non-Payment

The Company may freeze (suspend) the Organization's and Providers' access to the Software if any payment is not received within **{{PAYMENT_DUE_DAYS}}** after the due date. Suspension or termination of service for non-payment does not relieve the Organization of its obligation to pay all outstanding fees, including any accrued late charges and collection costs.
