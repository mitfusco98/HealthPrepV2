I do think that we need significantly more planning for the onboarding, multi-tenancy, and stripe payment. There are some key pages of interest: /auth/register, /admin/epic/registration, /admin/users (and their create, edit, deactivate, and delete actions), /root-admin/organizations/create, /root-admin/users (and their create, edit, deactivate, and delete actions), /root-admin/users/create, /root-admin/users/edit. These pages must be properly integrated into our flow. Preliminary, /auth/register should mirror the public sign up route of the website. Initial organization creation should be done autonomously or manually through the root admin dashboard. We need a select number of variables from practices to integrate: client ID and secret, payment info via Stripe, and standard documentation (name, email, phone number, address.) I disagree with the subscription tier models proposed and do not like the idea of capping the amount of patient population that the system can handle - the software is supposed to be robust, able to handle a large amounf of patients and documents at $100/month (or whatever flat rate is decided on). Custom pricing will only be available to hospital systems or physician groups by contract, if they are looking to implement our software in bulk across multiple clinics and sites (each should have their own individual client ID and secret to define their patient populaiton). I like the idea of a two week trial period before charging payment via Stripe - I want to encourage trialling. In that two weeks, the target demographic should realize the use case. Additionally, we are looking to strength security by adding verification questions for admin to act as 2FA - things like "what was the year of your graduating class?" or "what was your mother's maiden name?" . These fields should be associated with admin user accounts and stored. In general, this is about secure storage of credenitals in our database. Additionally, there should be a flow to reset passwords through email, both for admin and regular users.
