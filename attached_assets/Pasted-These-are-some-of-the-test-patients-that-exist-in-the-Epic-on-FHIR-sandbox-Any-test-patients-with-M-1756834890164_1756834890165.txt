Procedure
Below are Group FHIR IDs that can be used to test bulk FHIR calls in the sandbox.

To test bulk FHIR in the sandbox, you MUST select the Kick-off, Status Request, File Request, and Delete Request APIs along with the Search interaction of any APIs for which you want to export data.
For example, if you want to extract demographics and immunizations for patients in the relevant registry, you would add the following scopes to your application:
Bulk Data Kick-off
Bulk Data Status Request
Bulk Data File Request
Bulk Data Delete Request
Patient.Search (R4)
Immunization.Search (R4)
Your client record will automatically be granted access to the test FHIR Group below so long as you include all four bulk FHIR APIs in your registered application's API list.
