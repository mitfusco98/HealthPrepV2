Current Architecture Analysis
Your system already has a well-designed multi-tenant architecture where:

Each organization manages its own Epic credentials - This is evident from the Organization model having Epic-specific fields (epic_client_id, epic_client_secret, epic_fhir_url)

Organization admins handle their own integrations - The existing FHIR routes in routes/fhir_routes.py show that organization admins can configure Epic settings

Epic credentials are organization-scoped - The services/epic_fhir_service.py and emr/epic_integration.py services work with organization-specific configurations

Recommended Approach
Organization-level Epic registration with root admin oversight:

Primary Interface: Organization Admin Dashboard
Organization admins should register their own Epic apps
They know their specific Epic environment (sandbox vs production)
They have the clinical context for required scopes
They can manage their own OAuth redirect URIs
Root Admin Role: Oversight & Support
Monitor Epic connection status across organizations
Provide guidance and templates for Epic registration
Troubleshoot connection issues
Manage global Epic-related settings
Implementation Strategy
The current architecture already supports this - you just need to enhance the existing Epic configuration interface in the organization admin dashboard to include:

Epic App Registration Guidance - Step-by-step instructions
Scope Management - Predefined scope sets based on HealthPrep needs
Connection Testing - Validation tools for Epic credentials
Status Monitoring - Connection health checks
The root admin dashboard should have an Epic Overview section showing:

Which organizations have Epic configured
Connection status across all organizations
Organizations needing attention
This approach maintains the multi-tenant design principle while providing appropriate administrative oversight. Each clinic/organization can manage their own Epic integration independently, which is essential for Epic's app registration process since each organization will have their own Epic instance and specific requirements.
