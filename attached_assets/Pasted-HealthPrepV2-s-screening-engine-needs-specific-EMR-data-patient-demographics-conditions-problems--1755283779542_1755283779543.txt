HealthPrepV2’s screening engine needs specific EMR data: patient demographics, conditions (problems), lab and screening results, clinical documents, and encounter context. These correspond to the following FHIR resources in Epic:
* Patient – Represents the patient’s demographic info (name, DOB for age, gender, etc.). The screening engine uses this to determine age/gender-based screening eligibility In Epic’s FHIR, the Patient resource provides demographics and identifiers and is searchable by various parameters (e.g. name, MRN)
* Condition – Represents medical problems/diagnoses on the patient’s problem list (e.g. diabetes, hypertension). HealthPrepV2 uses these as trigger conditions to adjust screening criteria (for example, diabetics need more frequent HbA1c tests). Epic supports the Condition resource for problem lists. The Condition (Problems) API in Epic allows reading a patient’s active and past problems. This maps to HealthPrepV2’s use of conditions to filter screenings by relevant diagnoses.
* Observation – Represents discrete clinical observations such as lab results or vital signs. HealthPrepV2 might use lab observations (e.g. the last HbA1c value or a cholesterol level) to determine if a screening is up-to-date. Epic’s FHIR exposes lab results as Observation (Labs) resources that can be searched by patient. For example, a mammography result might appear as a radiology report; these could be retrieved either as text documents (see DocumentReference/DiagnosticReport) or structured observations if available.
* DocumentReference – Represents clinical documents or unstructured content in the EMR. This is crucial for HealthPrepV2, which currently ingests scanned documents and reports. Epic’s DocumentReference resource provides a list of available documents (e.g. PDFs, clinical notes, CDA documents) for a patient. The screening engine can use this to retrieve relevant documents by name or type (e.g. a “DXA scan report” PDF for bone density). In Epic’s FHIR, DocumentReference is the best match for any scanned or textual documents the engine would otherwise OCR. It covers clinical notes and external documents and can store metadata like document type, date, and an attachment or URL to the content.
* Encounter – Represents visits/appointments for the patient. While not directly used in screening logic, Encounter provides context such as upcoming appointments (for which a prep sheet is generated) or past visit dates. HealthPrepV2 can use the Encounter resource to identify the encounter for which a prep sheet is being prepared, or to tag any documentation (like a prep sheet note) to a specific visit in Epic. Epic’s FHIR supports reading and searching Encounters (the Encounter (Patient Chart) resource for patient visits). This ensures the app can link screening data or documents to the appropriate patient visit in Epic if needed.
Other FHIR resources may also be relevant (for example, DiagnosticReport for compiled test reports, or Appointment for scheduled visits). Notably, Epic’s FHIR provides DiagnosticReport for lab or imaging results in narrative form, which could complement Observations and DocumentReferences. However, the core resources listed above (Patient, Condition, Observation, DocumentReference, Encounter) cover the primary data that HealthPrepV2’s screening engine uses.
